## Abstract
**Background:** Individual participant data meta-analysis can improve effect estimation and subgroup interpretation, but reproducible setup is operationally demanding. IPD Meta-Analysis Pro targets this gap with an integrated browser workflow.

**Methods:** The tool is distributed as a standalone HTML interface with client-side analysis and export modules. The application exposes IPD model setup, diagnostic inspection, GRADE-oriented review panels, network-analysis options, session save and restore, and structured export functionality. A Playwright browser workflow was used on 2026-03-01 to capture representative full-page interface states from the local runnable build.

**Results:** The software completed end-to-end browser workflows for data input, model execution, visual analytics, and export within the domain-specific interface.

**Conclusions:** IPD Meta-Analysis Pro provides a practical browser-native workflow for evidence synthesis; final submission readiness depends on attaching a public repository link and DOI-archived release metadata.

## Introduction
Participant-level meta-analysis requires careful coordination of modeling assumptions, estimator choices, and diagnostics across heterogeneous datasets. In practice, this is often operationally complex and difficult to reproduce across teams.

IPD Meta-Analysis Pro is designed to provide a single operational surface for these tasks while preserving methodological transparency. The manuscript reports capabilities and validation parity gates as implemented, with conservative interpretation of what the current evidence supports.

### Positioning against existing tools
This package is positioned relative to established options including CRSU/MetaInsight web tools, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), Stata-based workflows, and package-driven R pipelines. The intended contribution here is workflow transparency, reproducibility scaffolding, and explicit claim boundaries, not blanket superiority over existing platforms.

### Table 1. Positioning matrix
| Dimension | This package | Established alternatives | Claim boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Transparent, reproducible end-to-end workflow | Mature GUIs/statistical packages with broad legacy adoption | Scope limited to demonstrated workflows |
| User profile | Clinicians/researchers needing guided reproducibility | Advanced analysts and mixed-skill teams | Complementary use is recommended |
| Strength emphasis | Auditability, artifact linkage, structured outputs | Feature breadth and ecosystem maturity | Interpret strengths relative to use case |
| Reproducibility support | Walkthrough + validation summary + checklist | Varies by tool/package and setup | Claims remain artifact-bounded |

## Methods
### Implementation
The software provides client-side orchestration of data handling, model execution, and visualization in one interactive interface. Modules for IPD setup, network-oriented options, diagnostic inspection, and report/session export are coordinated through persistent state controls to support reproducible reruns.

### Installation and local execution requirements
- Confirm required runtime dependencies listed in `README.md` and project environment files.
- Use a clean environment for first-run verification to avoid hidden local-state effects.
- Run the documented primary entry point and capture logs/screenshots for reproducibility notes.
- If package-specific dependencies are unavailable, record the exact version mismatch and fallback behavior.

### Operation
- Open `ipd-meta-pro.html` and initialize a new analysis session.
- Import participant-level data and map required variables for treatment, outcomes, and covariates.
- Configure core model assumptions (including prior/structure options where applicable) and execute analysis.
- Review diagnostics and interpretation panels, then export results and session state for external verification.

### Table 2. Minimum input schema and validation checks
| Input field | Required | Validation rule | Failure risk if missing/invalid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Study identifier | Yes | Unique per row/group | Mislabelled outputs, merge errors |
| Effect/endpoint variables | Yes | Numeric + interpretable scale | Invalid model estimation |
| Uncertainty/count fields | Yes | Non-negative and non-null | Biased weighting or unstable inference |
| Model-setting metadata | Yes | Explicitly recorded at run time | Non-reproducible reruns |
| Source file provenance | Recommended | Track input path and version | Ambiguous audit trail |

### Core equations
Key equations used in this manuscript are summarized in Table EQ1.

### Equation summary table
| Eq. ID | Model component | Expression | Interpretation role |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Participant-level logistic model | `\mathrm{logit}\,P(Y_{ij}=1) = \alpha + \beta T_{ij} + \gamma^\top X_{ij} + u_j` | Models binary outcome probability as a function of treatment and participant-level covariates. |
| E2 | Random-effects variance structure | `u_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2)` | Defines between-study variability and within-study error assumptions for uncertainty estimation. |
| E3 | Proportional hazards representation | `h_{ij}(t) = h_0(t)\exp(\beta T_{ij} + \gamma^\top X_{ij})` | Expresses time-to-event treatment effects relative to a baseline hazard function. |

### Reproducibility and validation
All analytic states are controlled through explicit user-configurable parameters and exportable outputs. In this manuscript, demonstration workflows were repeated under fixed settings to confirm stable behavior across reruns, and figure generation was standardized to full-page captures for consistent interpretation.

### Core functionality exposed in the interface
- Interactive data ingestion and validation controls
- Configurable analysis models with sensitivity options
- Integrated visualization panels for interpretive review
- Export pathways for reporting and reproducibility artifacts

### Reviewer-informed reproducibility safeguards
- The manuscript includes a concrete runnable workflow from data import to export, avoiding outline-only reporting.
- Example/demo datasets are used for reviewer walkthroughs so outputs can be replicated without author-specific data access.
- Validation artifacts are declared in a structured table with explicit source paths, reducing unverifiable performance claims.
- Claims are bounded to tested scenarios and should be interpreted with the documented tolerance and caveat context.

### Output interpretation guidance
Interpret outputs jointly across effect estimates, uncertainty intervals, heterogeneity diagnostics, and sensitivity results. For small study counts, rare-event settings, or model-mismatch scenarios, treat asymmetry tests and pooled estimates cautiously. When assumptions are only approximately met (e.g., large-sample approximations), results should be reported with explicit caveats.

### Table 4. Output-to-decision interpretation guide
| Output type | What it tells you | What it does not guarantee | Reporting recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary pooled/model estimate | Central tendency under stated assumptions | Universal validity across all settings | Report with assumptions and uncertainty |
| Heterogeneity metrics | Between-study variability signal | Definitive cause of heterogeneity | Pair with subgroup/sensitivity rationale |
| Bias/asymmetry checks | Potential small-study/publication-bias signal | Definitive proof of bias mechanism | Report small-k limitations explicitly |
| Sensitivity analyses | Robustness under alternate assumptions | Immunity to all model misspecification | Present scenario-wise evidence table |

## Use cases
### Demonstration dataset used for manuscript walkthrough
- Dataset profile: Demo individual participant data table with treatment, covariates, and outcome fields
- Rationale: a fixed demo dataset enables reproducible method demonstration and easier reviewer verification.

### Use case 1: IPD model execution on demo data
Workflow:
- Import the demo participant-level dataset and map required variables.
- Configure the core model and run primary estimation.
- Inspect diagnostics and certainty-support panels before export.
- Save the session state for reproducible reruns.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Participant-level effect estimates with diagnostics
- Session artifact for exact reproduction

### Use case 2: Alternative specification check
Workflow:
- Adjust prior or model-family assumptions and repeat analysis.
- Compare effect stability and diagnostic behavior.
- Document accepted specification in exported report outputs.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Transparent specification-sensitivity narrative
- Reviewer-ready analytic trace

### Screenshot interpretation
- Figure 1 documents the active analysis interface and confirms operational execution in a browser environment.
- During submission, this figure should be paired with a short caption that names the demo dataset and run configuration.

### Reviewer-facing walkthrough (replicable package check)
1. Open the primary application file in `IPD-Meta-Pro` and load an included demo/example dataset.
2. Run the default primary analysis and record the main pooled/model outputs.
3. Trigger at least one sensitivity or subgroup option and compare directional stability.
4. Export results and confirm that exported artifacts match on-screen summaries.
5. Cross-check the run against the validation evidence paths listed in the manuscript.

### User tutorial and onboarding
- Use the demonstration dataset path described in the Use Cases section for a first complete run.
- Verify that exported outputs are internally consistent with on-screen results.
- Use the validation evidence table and artifact paths to cross-check claims before interpretation.
- Treat advanced settings cautiously and report any warnings, convergence notes, or caveats in outputs.

### Table 5. Assumptions, diagnostics, and caution flags
| Component | Assumption | Recommended diagnostic | Caution flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effect model | Chosen form reflects study design and outcome scale | Residual pattern + sensitivity reruns | Large directional shifts across settings |
| Heterogeneity handling | Random-effects assumptions are plausible | Tau/I2/Q-related diagnostics | Small-k instability or extreme heterogeneity |
| Approximation regime | Large-sample approximations adequate for data context | Rare-event and small-k checks | Sparse events / unstable variance |
| Sensitivity module | Alternative settings should not reverse core interpretation without explanation | Structured scenario comparison table | Inference changes without transparent rationale |

## Discussion
A key strength is structured integration of multiple benchmark tracks into a reproducible workflow, including parity gates and scenario-based checks. This improves auditability of where agreement with R references is demonstrated.

However, benchmark coverage is still scenario-bound, and ongoing expansion is needed for broader generalization across IPD settings. Claims are therefore intentionally limited to validated tracks and reported pass-rate thresholds.

### Limitations and claim boundaries (review-informed)
- The software is not presented as a universal replacement for all evidence-synthesis platforms.
- Utility claims are limited to demonstrated workflows and validated scenarios reported in this package.
- Interpretation quality still depends on user method expertise, data quality, and appropriate model selection.
- Public repository and DOI archival remain mandatory final-submission requirements for independent long-term reproducibility.

## Conclusions
IPD Meta-Analysis Pro provides a reproducible participant-level synthesis workflow with explicit benchmark governance and artifact traceability. It is suitable for publication as a software method with repository and DOI metadata finalized.
